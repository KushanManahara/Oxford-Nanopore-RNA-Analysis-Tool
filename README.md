# Oxford Nanopore | RNA Analysis Tool
### Welcome to the Oxford Nanopore RNA Analysis Tool repository!

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for our web application designed to simplify RNA sequence analysis using Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that enables researchers, regardless of their programming background, to analyze RNA data efficiently and effectively.
## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our web application offers an intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
- **Nanopore Sequencing Support:** Analyze RNA data generated from Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology.
- **Simple Workflow:** Perform various analyses and visualizations with just a few clicks.
- **Accessible to Non-Programmers:** No programming knowledge required. Anyone can analyze RNA data effortlessly.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore your RNA data through interactive charts and graphs.


## Getting Started

To get started with our RNA Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KushanManahara/Oxford-Nanopore-RNA-Analysis-Tool.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the project repository.
   ```
   cd Oxford-Nanopore-RNA-Analysis-Tool
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment (not necessary)

   In Windows
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
   In Linux/MacOS
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
6. Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Run the web application using your preferred web server.
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
## Usage Instructions
- Log in to your server using the provided `host` `username` and `password`.
- Navigate to the **blasting page**.
- Upload your `raw files` as a `.zip` file. The zip file should contain two files, one starting with `'pass_'` and the other with `'fail_'`.
- The pipeline will run, generating the final blasting output as a zip file, which includes the **final blasting report**, **Venn diagram**, and **quality analysis report**.
